## The Electroencephalogram Control System

**Project Members:** Shakhar Dasgupta, Christopher Wells, Kyle Zeller

The Electroencephalogram Control System is a project that was created to use an electroencephalogram device to control various devices.

The project started with using the Muse EEG Headband to recognize specific user actions such as blinking and jaw clenching. Those signals were then used to control GUI applications and LED lights using an Aurdino. Later on the concentration signal of the Muse was used in addition to control LED lights, and eventually a robotic car.

A Java library was created for to allow different applications to use the same signal analysis for the Muse device. The library was placed on [GitHub](https://github.com/SUNY-Oswego-MUSE-Project/muse-gestures) and released under the [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) software license.

A presentation for the project was given at [SUNY Oswego's Quest](https://www.oswego.edu/quest/), on April 13, 2016 at 1PM in Shineman 174.

For the presentation at Quest, the project recieved the [Sigma Xi / ORSP Quest 2016 award](https://www.oswego.edu/rise/sigma-xi-orsp-research-award).
